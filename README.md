# Firebase Auth + Firestore Template (React)

A minimal boilerplate for Firebase-backed apps that use Firebase Auth and Firestore. Designed for rapid prototyping or launching production-ready JAMstack apps with secure user authentication and real-time database.

## Features

- üîê Firebase Email/Password Authentication
- üìÅ User-specific Firestore document collections
- üåê Environment config via `.env`
- üõ† Easy to deploy and customize

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/firebase-auth-firestore-template.git
   cd firebase-auth-firestore-template
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up Firebase:
   - Go to [firebase.google.com](https://firebase.google.com/)
   - Create a project
   - Enable Email/Password Auth
   - Create a Firestore DB
   - Get your config keys and paste them in `.env`

4. Run the app:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

## Deployment

Use Vercel, Netlify, or Firebase Hosting. Just make sure to add your `.env` vars to their settings.

## Notes
This template is based on a production setup used in a real investigative tool (Ember Relay) and follows best practices for deploying small, secure Firebase-backed apps.

## Why I Made This
This template is based on real infrastructure I built and deployed for Ember Relay, an AI-powered investigative tool. I created this public version to help other devs ‚Äî and to showcase my systems experience to potential clients.
